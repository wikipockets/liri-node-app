# liri-node-app
LIRI node application
# Functionality
This app is like Siri but takes in text instead of voice. 
 -> The app references Spotify, Bands-in-Town, and OMDB.
 -> Liri can find songs, local concerts, and movie information, as well get a random text file and fill in a "random" band, spotify  
    song, or concert event
# Use commands 
  -> // concert-this
     // spotify-this-song
     // movie-this
